-This app Contains a Home page and a Survey page. <br>
-Survey page displays questions and provides range and input fields for ratings.<br>
-Questions are stored locally in a json file for easy access, where each question's data in JSON file consist of question ID, question, rating type (number/text) and range (if rating type = number).<br> 
-We can add as many questions as we want but we need to make sure that results are stored in a permanent storage or database after submission since redirecting to another page might erase locally stored data!<br>
-Once submitted, the page redirects to home page after 5 seconds.<br>
